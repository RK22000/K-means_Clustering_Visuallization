K-means

I think I fell asleep in class when k-means was covered cuz I recently realized that I didn't actually trust my understanding of the K-means algorithm. So I read the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to recap what it is, confirmed that I did actually fall asleep which is why I don't remember this clearly, and coded up a visualization of K-means cuz I realized that its a cool algorithm.

Here's a an example run from the visualization.
